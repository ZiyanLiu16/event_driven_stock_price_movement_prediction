## Current Focus:


1) learn to predict delta in close price and open price of next day based on news released between market closing and opening of the next day.
2) assume price change is independed affected by each news; i.e. see it as a text classification problem where sign of delta is predicted based on the single piece of text. 
3) keep track of interday data for future study



##  Next Step:


link price change with news
set up cronjob to retrieve data every day
explore models
